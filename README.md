Crypto-mining, the process of validating cryptocurrency transactions, has gained popularity in recent years. However, it has also become a major cause of pollution due to the high energy consumption required to power the computers used in the process. The increasing demand for cryptocurrency has led to a surge in mining, exacerbating the environmental impact upto 0.3% of total greenhouse gas emission. Terrader is a web based game in the form of a crypto-trading simulator that functions with respect to a carbon footprint, carbon score and strategic gameplay; and has other interesting side-features to increase awareness among the players on how a fruitful and trending practice has an unnoticed contribution to climate change. 

The game has 4 different kinds of Cryptocurrency coins with names - TerraCoin, Gaiacoin, Envirocoin and DharaCoin. A fake currency of $500 is distributed to all the players/traders to trade with. 

A superior reward known as the Carbon Credit is earned throughout the game based on the effective trades each player makes. Carbon credits can also be earned through real money. These credits are then used to buy power-ups that could be used in the game and benefit the player in certain ways. 

Terrader is a free for all game where a person competes against everyone in a room of 50-100 traders. The game also allows friendly trades of carbon credits and power-ups among friends. Friends can also create private parties and invite their fellow traders/join their party rooms. 

A carbon footprint meter is displayed on the main game screen so that players make their trades in hopes of reducing the carbon footprint and hence saving the environment virtually. 

Each trade will result in a carbon score being increased or decreased with respect to the efficiency and sustainability of the trades. Carbon score is the deciding factor of the leaderboard that updates every 2 minutes in a single game of 15 minutes (whose timeer is displayed on the top right at the start of the game).
